## UFO_javascript
wk14-HW

I used javaScript to create a table dynamically from a provided dataset, about UFO-sightings. The dataset is mapped one cell at-a-time into a table on the HTML page.

Appended a table with the following columns to the webpage which has a new row of data for each UFO sighting:
Date/time  |  City  |  State  |  Country  |  Shape  |  Comment

I use javascript to listen for user input to apply a custom filter to the data, then remap the dataset, creating a new table.
